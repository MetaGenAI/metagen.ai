Hawoo everyone!

As a years long denizen of the metaverse (NeosVR, VRChat, etc), plus general futurist/transhumanist-inclined Oxford graduate, I have stumbled on conversations about blockchain many times, from very varied people: from economy professors, computer science students, web3 founders, to other denicens of Social VR platforms and so-called metaverses. I thought I would share here some of my insights/thoughts, with the hope that they may be found useful by some, and with the underlaying hope of creating more common understanding by all.

*Let's dig a bit into the reactions people have about blockchain*. Some common ones are:

 1. People associate blockchain with scammers
 2. Some argue that "you don't need blockchain" because "there are better ways to achieve the thing" or at least "other ways may be just as good so why use this"
 3. Some swear by all its promisses, and consider deniers to be short-sighted.
 4. Some just want to make money
 5. Some just don't find it interesting.

What is going on really? I think that most of the arguments are just rationalizations of two underlaying knee-jerk reactions: 

 1. you find money and monetization attractive
 2. you are suspicious of anything that involves money and monetization

Let's explore these two profiles, in a classical thesis-antithesis-synthesis framework.

I find money and monetization attractive (thesis)

I think this stems from a believe that money and monetization are *deeply fundamental* to a functioning and flourishing society. Money and monetization are tied with contepts of ownership and personal liberty, which are considered corner stones of a good and advancing society.

**I find money and monetization suspicious/unattractive (antithesis)**

I think this stems from the believe that money and monetization are just tools to refer to *real valuable stuff* and on themselves are worthless. This belief is combined with the belief that people who are "obsessed" with money have probably lost sight of the true value of things -- they have confused the symbol with the referent. When you spend more time thinking about the proxy of value, you are automatically spending less time thinking about the valuable thing itself, thus money-obssesed people lose track of what's valuable and may thus engage in behavior that is not that well algined with our "real values", e.g. speculation, or even scamming and corruption.

**Money and monetization are very useful but we shouldn't lose sight of real values (synthesis)**

This synthesis is a natural one. People starting from either extreme reaction will often converge to this without noticing it. Let's see how this has been happening starting from either side.

**Arriving at the synthesis from the antithesis**

I think VRChat offers a great case study. Why does the VRChat community love VRChat so much? Because it's so *authentic*, so *genuine*. It honestly gives me chills. When you start a platform without any monetization, just like early-stage open source projects, what you get is a *labour of love* -- an expression of the purest human values, without any abstraction layers -- what users built in VRChat was *what they really felt like building deep down*.
This is extremely attractive. And you can see it. You can go around VRChat and find memes, funny references, and tons, TONS, of pictures of memories of people just being human (or trans-human, or whatever) together. Only in VRChat -- as of today -- do you frequently stumble upon worlds like a little shrine with messages from people in a Japanese study group telling their stories and how grateful they are of the community, or get events with 15K attendants without any sponsor, and with money raised for charity, or get clubbing events going every night, with underdog DJs starting their career out of pure love, all for free.
Last weekend I was at the Sunday service event in VRChat. This is a little church may by a member of some furry community. The thing that stroke me the most however were the walls. They were *covered to the brim* of stickers and decorations. The thing is that I recognized some of these. Each of these little symbols represented an idea (e.g. trans rights) or a communiy (e.g. Floof Doof). Every literal square meter of the walls in this place was *tingligng with meaning* -- and I think that's beautiful.

And this is just a tinty glimpse of it.

However, there's another trend that I can't help but notice, going on. People made fun of the corporation in Ready Player One for wanting to fill the screenspace with ads. Well guess what's the first thing you see, pretty much covering your field of view, the first time you enter some of the most popular VRChat worlds (like the Pug, or Midnight rooftop): tons of ads, stuck to the walls. These are offered at a price by the world creators to support themselves obviously. Some world creators also make some parts of their worlds VIP only (e.g. in Spirits of the Sea or Dreamwaves), so that you can only access them if you pay.

Somehow, the fact that this has emerged organically makes people less bothered than if this had been the norm since the beginning. If VRChat had offered ad spaces or "VIP worlds" you need to pay for, these would have been labelled as "invasive" and as "artificial scarcity", I think. I think this isn't totally unreasonable though. People only begin trusting the more abstract foundations of society, such as money, once the foundational valuable stuff has been stablished. Otherwise, once feels at risk of it being a scam or a speculative bubble.

This doesn't change the fact that, eventually, as a platform and community grows, money and monetization are found increasingly useful. Turns out that money is a very useful tool to coordinate among very large numbers of people. Furthermore, the tools to make money work are very non-trivial. As a community grows, these challenges become more and more apparent, and it's in fact the foundation of a lot of work by a lot of smart and some well-intentioned people. One person which I think is pushing the frontiers of this knowledge (how to coordinate the largest numbers of people and make societies work) is Vitalik Buterin, the funder of Ethereum. And thus we arrive at the synthesis: money is useful, but needs to be based on real values.
