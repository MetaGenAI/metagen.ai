# Recording tools

There are several tools available to record VR data, including motion, voice, video, etc. Here I list the main ones.

## MetaGenNeos

MetaGenNeos is a tool to record multimodal data of multiple participants in NeosVR. It is able to record, for all the users in the session

 - Movement (up to any number of trackers Neos supports, as well as fingers)
 - Face and eye tracking
 - Voice
 - Hearing (stereoscopic, from the perspective of one user)
 - Vision (records video from the perspective of the users)
 - Arbitrary Neos data fields, and slots
 - *Soon: haptic data*
